# loops_predict

Howdy!

Predict #1
The code will execute and print 0 to 14. 

Predict #2
The console will print 3, 6, & 9.

^^^ I ran the code and forgot to check with a t chart to see if i would equal 6. I would've found it doesn't! 

Predict #3
Console Log will print:
Line    Value
1       1
2       4
3       5
4       8
5       10
6       11
7       14
8       16
